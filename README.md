# UoA Badminton Club Event Registration & Payments System.

Project initiated by WDCC in 2023.

## About

The goal of this project is to build an Event Registration and Payment Portal for UABC (University of Auckland Badminton Club).

## Getting started

Refer to the [Onboarding](https://github.com/UoaWDCC/uabc-portal/wiki/Onboarding) page on the wiki to get started.

It is recommended to use `volta` to manage your node version. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```
_Alternatively_ you may use `nvm` and corepack to manage your node version.

```bash
corepack enable
```
Then you can get started developing using the following commands:
```bash
yarn
```
