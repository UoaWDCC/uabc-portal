# Introduction

> The right section will contain all the information about *Body* and *Header* parameters

Welcome to the UABC API! The documentation aims to help current and future developers understand all the endpoints present.


<!-- # Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
